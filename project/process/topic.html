			<h1>1/19/17: Three ISEA Topics 2017</h1>
		</header>

		<section id="entries">

					<p><b>Interdiscplinary platforms for coexistence: </b>One ISEA topic that I have is to create an interactive banner that showed different wage gaps across the planet. I would collect data entries from around the world that showcased the various salaries for the same positions in the same regions, and visualize the wage gap.  </p><br>

<p><b>Media, Art, Landscape and Heritage:</b> The second ISEA topic that I have is to generate a gallery of traditional and digital artwork from around the world that formed in the shape of the globe or the world. The user is able to interact with the visuals by rotating the globe either with a touch screen or with a mouse using a slider, and then as the user hovers over.</p><br>

<p><b>Design, Art, Science, and Technology:</b> Much of the world today is engulfged in the use of smartphones. Smartphone usage has risen drastically, and not always to our benefit. My idea is to track the hours of usage that each person uses on their smartphone throughout the day, and in the end record what each user learned through using their smartphone. These topics would be categorized, and in the end we can learn all of the similar vs different topics we all look at on our smartphones. You can then view topics by region. For example, in Davis we can view the most popular topics that people read and how long they read the topic or viewed the video for.</p><br>
