		<h3>BestParking.com</h3>
		<img src="pics/bestparking.png" alt="bestparking" width="600" height="375">
		<p><b>Interface: </b>The interface of Best Parking is outdated, to say the least. The trend nowadays is full-width images, bright colors, and large, sharp sans-serif text with flat imagery/icons. BestParking has none of these attributes, as they employ layers upon layers of cityscape vectors with a desaturated blue and a lot of white space. Most sites nowadays utilize a majority of the space. The buttons are 3D (not flat) and shadows are also used. </p><br>

		<p><b>Interaction Design:</b> The interaction design is relatively straightforward. With the menu on the left and few options to choose from, the map with flags indicating price and location of available parking spots, the user can easily navigate around the primary function of the site. The options to choose from include City/Airport, Location, Time, Type, Arrival and Departure times.One fatal flaw of the design is that the buttonsfor the dropdown menus are faded out, so it is extremely hard to tell
			if the menu is interactive or not. </p><br>

		<p><b>Overall Experience:</b> My experience was short-lived primarily because I realized that Davis, California was not an option in the cities that the application works in.The outdated interface did not help with this at all, as the website felt oudated and even though it was a fast website, it looked like a slow one with the choppy loading animations. </p><br>

		<h3>ParkWhiz.com</h3>
		<img src="pics/parkwhiz.png" alt="parkwhiz" width="600" height="375">
		<p><b>Interface: </b>The interface of ParkWhiz is much cleaner and updated than BestParking. The text is much larger, and it is much easier to tell that buttons were interactive buttons, the color palette for the site was pleasing to the eye, the entire space is utilized well, and the design is absolutely eye-catching. When I load the site, I immediately want to explore more of it and see what else ParkWhiz has to offer. </p><br>

		<img src="pics/parkwhiz-checkout.png" alt="parkwhiz-checkout" width="600" height="375">
		<p><b>Interaction Design:</b> Interaction on ParkWhiz is similar to the interaction design experience I had on BestParking.com. The load times were fast and there were minimal animations involved. However, the dropdown menus came down on hover, not on activation, and I liked that a lot more for the nav bar. Choosing the time range was much better displayed though, as an entire calendar came down with more times, so much more can be done more efficiently. However, one of the biggest letdowns of ParkWhiz was the slow loading images. When everything else felt lightning fast, the images of parking garages really slowed the experience down.
		</p><br>

		<p><b>Overall Experience:</b> My experience was a 9/10 with ParkWhiz.com. I thoroughly enjoyed my time on their site, as it was updated, bright, clean, and colorful, but not overdone. I knew that I wanted to explore more and actually try out more of the website to see what else it had to offer me. If they just optimize their images, I would easily rate this site a perfect 10/100.

		<h3>SpotHero.com</h3>

		<img src="pics/spothero-results.png" alt="spothero-results" width="600" height="375">
		<p><b>Interface: </b>The interface of Spot Hero is efficient, but it is miles away from being considered up to date. Mainly it is due to the font choices they made for their website. I enjoy using the navigation bar (moreso looking at it) much more than using their menu, as their menu's font choice is not smooth or strong weights. Rather it is pixellated and really thin, making it a little more painful to read in today's standards. However, giving it another chance, the interface is simple and not confusing at all.
		</p><br>

		<img src="pics/spothero-checkout.png" alt"spothero-checkout" width="600" height="375">
		<p><b>Interaction Design:</b> Oddly enough, SpotHero's Interaction Design aspect of their website shines the most out of their checkout page. Everything loads nicely as each box jumps up happily to fill up the space once a parking spot is chosen. The animations were a bit choppy but the design is not a failure, either.
		</p><br>

		<p><b>Overall Experience:</b> My overall experience with SpotHero was uninspiring. It was just a normal visit to a very normal website. I definitely would not choose Spot Hero as my first choice if I were to reserve a parking spot somewhere, but nor would I say it is a last choice for me either.
