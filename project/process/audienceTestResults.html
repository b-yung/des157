		<p><b>Description of Experience: </b> User Testing was really helpful because I learned a lot about my website and what features are missing. I also learned about what is broken in my design. </p><br>

		<p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned that I should incorporate more cursor states into my project. I also learned that the header should be a smaller size because it takes away from the map experience. </p><br>

		<p><b>Updates:</b> For the next iteration, I want to add more career salaries. I also want to move the info window around with the cursor so that the user doesn't have to shift his/her eyes across the screen to view the information that comes up.  </p><br>
