		<p><b>Description of Experience: </b> User Testing was really helpful because I learned a lot about my website and what features are missing. I also learned about what is broken in my design, which I will elaborate on later. I was able to land 3 different testers: Cameron, Anwana, and a graduate from UC Davis who also studied DES 157. They all used my site to its fullest, and they gave me excellent feedback.</p><br>

		<p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned that I should incorporate more cursor states into my project, specifically I should add in more information when the user clicks on the states. I also learned that the header should be a smaller size because it takes away from the map experience. I should fix up my UI in general because it is not organized and does not consider the user enough. More information should be added because the site is too simple at this stage.</p><br>

		<p><b>Updates:</b> For the next iteration, I want to add more career salaries. I also want to move the info window around with the cursor so that the user doesn't have to shift his/her eyes across the screen to view the information that comes up. Another update that I should work on is to combine the legend and the menu colors since they are repetitive.  </p><br>
