		<p><b>Interdiscplinary platforms for coexistence: </b>The ISEA topic that I chose is to create an interactive world or application/website that showed different wage gaps across the planet. I would collect data entries from around the world that showcased the various salaries for the same positions in the same regions, and visualize the wage gap. Visualizations do a great job of showing people just how they stand among others in similar fields, and ideally they could change various factors to see what factors impact the wage gap around the world for similar jobs.</p><br>
