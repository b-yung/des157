            <h2>Motiv Tag</h2>
            <p>The Motiv Tag is meant for short to medium oil, and is stronger than a  typical light-oil ball. I picked up this ball just recently after a lot of hestitation, but I love it!</p>

            <h2>DV8 Vandal</h2>
            <p>The DV8 Vandal is meant for medium to long oil. I really only bring out this ball during tournaments since it's way too strong for normal daily play.</p>

            <h2>Storm Punch-Out</h2>
            <p>The Storm Punch-Out is meant for short to medium oil, and is meant to really snap in the back-end. This is one of my go-to balls for normal everyday play and especially for tournaments.</p>

        <aside id="badAnswer" class="hide">
            <h2>Hammer Bad Intentions</h2>
            <p>The Hammer Bad Intentions is an extremely strong ball that has a smooth motion throughout. Like the Vandal and Marvel S, I only bring this ball out during tournaments because of its overwhelming strength.</p>

        <aside id="marvelAnswer"  class="hide">
            <h2>Storm Marvel S</h2>
            <p>The Storm Marvel-S is a recreation of the Storm Marvel, but with a solid coverstock that enables it to have a smooth motion and finish strong in the back-end. Like the Vandal and the Bad Intentions, I only bring this ball out during tournaments since it is extremely strong. It is the strongest of all six balls that I own.</p>

        <aside id="gbAnswer" class="hide">
            <h2>Ebonite Gamebreaker</h2>
            <p>The Ebonite GameBreaker 2 is a great go-to ball for a lot of bowlers, because of its controllable motion on the lane and its hard hitting power. I bring this out occasionally if I want something that hits really strong and is still controllable.</p>
