		<p>Yung, Brandon, DES 157 In Chapter 13 of “Don’t Make Me Think,” Steve Krug explains the differences between usability and user centered design, and the significance of incorporating the principles behind user centered research into an environment where
			usability is not supported.</p>
		<p> “Usability” and “User Centered Design,” or UCD were terms that people used to describe any efforts to design with the user in mind. Usability and Information Architecture were the primary professions focused on Web site usability, but now we mostly hear User Experience Design, or UX. UCD focuses on the whole product’s usability, while UX considers the users’ needs at every stage of the product life cycle. To build support for usability in the workplace, we should relate it to the company’s Return of Investment, and also speaking in terms of relevant issues for the company. There are five ways that you can convince the office to support usability, which include getting your boss to watch a usability test, do the first test on your own time, test out the competition, empathize with management, and know your place in the grand scheme of things. We should never try to focus on users’ desires, as this often links to deception and manipulation. Evernote incorporated user-testing to increase
			user retention by 15 percent, specifically by understanding customer interactions and streamlining the sign up process. </p>
		<p>Although Krug offers solid points for incorporating usability into the production stage, I believe there should be more clarity on what makes a product “better.” Everyone uses applications and websites differently, so what makes something better is
			subjective but Krug makes it sound like there is only one right answer. All in all, Krug’s guides are only meant to be guides, and so he advises to push the constraints if better for the user.</p>

		<h4>Evaluation of Studio 5 Design</h4>
		<img src="studio5.png" alt="studio5" width="600" height="482">
		<p>The library that I used was primarily Mapbox. Mapbox is an amazing library that has been developed extremely well, and to me seems like one of the most developed libraries out there. The capabilities that come with it are endless. It has countless pages
			of examples on exactly the things that you can imagine to do with a mapping library, and all of the pages provide code to follow along. They even have tutorials and documentation for everything you would want to learn to do. </p>

		<h4>Evaluation of Studio 4 Design</h4>
		<img src="studio4.png" alt="studio4" width="600" height="431">
		<p>One priority to tie in all the visual elements together as part of one, single user interface was to make sure all the lements maintained a consistent visual design. One of the ways in which I did this was to use a popping color scheme, and make sure
			all the elements correlated with the rest. Having differently colored elements that had the same function would not work well. In addition, I made sure I had the hover states to be visually attractive and not hard to miss. </p>

		<h4>Evaluation of Studio 3 Design</h4>
		<img src="studio3.png" alt="studio3" width="600" height="465">
		<p>I edited the image so that the interactive elements would be visually different from the rest of the image. I chose to desaturate each of the 6 bowling balls in order to indicate that there was something "missing" from them, and so the user would hover
			over each one to find out more information. Thus, I left out a CTA. Three ways in which this is an effective and interesting interface design is that there is no CTA (the user should be able to find out on his/her own), the images are all custom-shaped
			(no circles or rectangles), and lastly the videos are all custom-shot as well.</p>

		<p><b>Priority:</b> Do the elements have a hierarchy in Size, Color, and Zoning?</p>The design of the form is extremely straightforward, although it is aesthetically also very plain and doesn't have much going on. However, it is still informative and does
		it purpose.<br>

		<p><b>Clarity:</b> Does the interface communicate clearly in Words, Icons and Color? The hierarchy is also straightforward, with a large header and some basic form boxes for basically all of the options. There are NO icons used, and minimal color as well,
			so those are areas in which it can improve upon. The boxes are all in the same width, though they can definitely bring an advantage to expand further.</p><br>

		<p><b>Purpose:</b> Does the product maintain its essence in Simplicity, Perspective and Restraint? The product does maintain its essence in Simplicity, although it is a little too simple given all the information that it is attempting to gather from the
			user. Specifically, a variation in the size of the text boxes would let the user know that it's a different kind of entry, not a paragraph entry needed for all of the inputs.</p>

		<h3>Blog Post #1 1/12/17</h3>
		<img src="reddit.png" alt="reddit" width="600" height="331">
		<p>I ultimately chose Reddit as my choice of interface design to evaluate. The reason I chose Reddit was because Reddit is one of the most popular interfaces browsed around the world, and it features many different types of users. However, all users have
			one purpose on the site – they seek information and so they want to learn. </p><br>

		<p><b>Design:</b> The design of Reddit is straightforward, though it is definitely outdated. The white background is meant to enable users to read text easily, and the lack of imagery and animations in general enables users to load the page as quickly
			as possible. This goes hand-in-hand with Reddit being a text-heavy site. Users come to the site to converse with each other, read each other’s comments, and write their own. The consistency and the spacing of the website make the site very easy to
			use.
		</p><br>

		<p><b>Appeal:</b> To put it bluntly, Reddit relies on its content for appeal to users, not its aesthetic appeal. Nevertheless, thousands of users visit the site every hour to refresh themselves on the news and to read each other’s opinions on countless
			topics.
		</p><br>

		<p><b>Effectiveness:</b> Ultimately, type hierarchy and consistent spacing are the main reasons why Reddit is able to function as a heavy-duty website. However, I would not rate it as ‘effective’ as it is easy to drown oneself in all of the content that
			it has to offer, as there are nearly a hundred clickable links but only 3 different colors for the links. </p>
