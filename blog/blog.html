					<p>I ultimately chose Reddit as my choice of interface design to evaluate. The reason I chose Reddit was because Reddit is one of the most popular interfaces browsed around the world, and it features many different types of users. However, all users have one purpose on the site – they seek information and so they want to learn. </p><br>

<p><b>Design:</b> The design of Reddit is straightforward, though it is definitely outdated. The white background is meant to enable users to read text easily, and the lack of imagery and animations in general enables users to load the page as quickly as possible. This goes hand-in-hand with Reddit being a text-heavy site. Users come to the site to converse with each other, read each other’s comments, and write their own. The consistency and the spacing of the website make the site very easy to use.</p><br>

<p><b>Appeal:</b> To put it bluntly, Reddit relies on its content for appeal to users, not its aesthetic appeal. Nevertheless, thousands of users visit the site every hour to refresh themselves on the news and to read each other’s opinions on countless topics.</p><br>

<p><b>Effectiveness:</b> Ultimately, type hierarchy and consistent spacing are the main reasons why Reddit is able to function as a heavy-duty website. However, I would not rate it as ‘effective’ as it is easy to drown oneself in all of the content that it has to offer, as there are nearly a hundred clickable links but only 3 different colors for the links. </p>
