	        <time>1999</time> By around 3 years old, I had my first pair of toddler shoes and I also started playing soccer, so I even got my first pair of cleats!

	        <time>2008</time>I finally purchased my first pair of running shoes as I was entering high school. I was starting a new sport in my life, which was cross country, and I knew that I'd be running a lot. I wore these shoes everywhere I went.

      <li id="spikes"><div class="tip" id="spikesTip">like a pineapple</div>
	      <div>
	        <time>2009</time> I waited another year until I could get my first pair of spikes for short-distance sprints. I ended up getting my brother's hand-me-downs, which I liked a lot.

      <li id="thous"><div class="tip" id="thousTip">Yung No Mo :'/</div>
	      <div>
	        <time>2015</time> This is the year I really went splurging like no other... I finally decided to grow up and purchase my first pair of adult shoes with fashion in mind. Thus, I bought a pair of Wolverine 1000 Mile boots that are made to withstand weather.
